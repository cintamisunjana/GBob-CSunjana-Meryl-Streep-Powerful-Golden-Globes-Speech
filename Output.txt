 thank you very much thank you very much thank you please sit down please sit down thank you i love you all youll have to forgive me ive lost my voice in screaming and lamentation this weekend and i have lost my mind sometime earlier this year so i have to read thank you hollywood foreign press just to pick up on what hugh laurie said you and all of us in this room really belong to the most vilified segments in american society right now think about it hollywood foreigners and the press but who are we and you know what is hollywood anyway its just a bunch of people from other places i was born and raised and created in the public schools of new jersey viola davis was born in a sharecroppers cabin in south carolina and grew up in central falls rhode island sarah paulson was raised by a single mom in brooklyn sarah jessica parker was one of seven or eight kids from ohio amy adams was born in italy natalie portman was born in jerusalem where are their birth certificates and the beautiful ruth negga was born in ethiopia raised in  no in ireland i do believe and shes here nominated for playing a small town girl from virginia ryan gosling like all the nicest people is canadian and dev patel was born in kenya raised in london is here for playing an indian raised in tasmania hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners if you kick em all out youll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts which are not the arts they gave me three seconds to say this an actors only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like and there were many many many powerful performances this year that did exactly that breathtaking passionate work there was one performance this year that stunned me it sank its hooks in my heart not because it was good there was nothing good about it but it was effective and it did its job it made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth it was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter someone he outranked in privilege power and the capacity to fight back it kind of broke my heart when i saw it i still cant get it out of my head because it wasnt in a movie it was real life and this instinct to humiliate when its modeled by someone in the public platform by someone powerful it filters down into everybodys life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing disrespect invites disrespect violence incites violence when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose this brings me to the press we need the principled press to hold power to account to call them on the carpet for every outragethats why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in our constitution so i only ask the famously wellheeled hollywood foreign press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the committee to protect journalists because were going to need them going forward and theyll need us to safeguard the truth one more thing once when i was standing around on the set one day whining about something we were going to work through supper or the long hours or whatever tommy lee jones said to me isnt it such a privilege meryl just to be an actor yeah it is and we have to remind each other of the privilege and the responsibility of the act of empathy we should all be very proud of the work hollywood honors here tonight as my friend the dear departed princess leia said to me once take your broken heart make it into art thank you
